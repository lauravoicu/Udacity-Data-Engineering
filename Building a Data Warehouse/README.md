# Sparkify's Data Warehouse ETL process

## Project description

Sparkify is a music streaming startup with a growing user base and song database.

Their user activity and songs metadata data resides in json files in S3. The goal of the current project is to build an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to. 

## Project Structure

The project contains the following scripts (the order here implies the logical ordering of how to run them)

1. Fill all configuration parameters in the config file (`dwh.cfg`), but leave the following two fields empty (these will be written by the `create_cluster.py` script) 
 - `HOST` (inside the `DB` configuration section) 
 - And the `ARN` (inside the `IAM_ROLE` configuration section) 

2. Run the *create_cluster* script to set up the infrastructure for this project.

3. Run the *create_tables* script to set up the database staging and analytical tables

4. Run the *etl* script to extract data from the files in S3, stage it in redshift and store it in the dimensional tables.

5. Run the *etl* script to extract data from the files in S3, stage it in redshift and store it in the dimensional tables.

6. Run the *validate_project* script to verify that the project was completed successfully. The script performs a simple count of each analytical table.

7. Run the *destroy_cluster* script to delete the created AWS Redshift cluster.

## Database Design

**Staging Tables**
- staging_events
- staging_songs

**Fact Table**
- songplays - records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong 

**Dimension Tables**
- users - users in the app 
- songs - songs in music database 
- artists - artists in music database 
- time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
